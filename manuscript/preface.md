# Preface

## Who This Book Is For

This book grew out of an accelerated introduction to Python at the University 
of Wyoming. It is meant as an introduction to programming, so it does not
assume any prior programming experience. But, unlike other introductory texts,
its philosophy is that you will learn programming better by learning not just a
computer language, but also related frameworks. In other words, it is better to
learn how to build a chart with the use of a sophisticated charting package, 
than it is to learn how to loop through an array to find its maximum and 
minimum values.

In other words, this book is not intended to teach you the syntax of 
Python and a handful of simple algorithms that you can write in Python.
Instead, my goal is to teach you how to write Python programs that are actually
useful in the context of data science, and that means showing you some of the
Python libraries that are popular in data science, such as NumPy, pandas, 
and matplotlib. With this goal in mind, I have chosen several different 
projects that are illustrative of data science goals. Some of the projects
have surprising depth, e.g., Eigenvectors, Markov processes, hill climbing,
etc., but I will not dive into these depths, choosing instead to keep the
focus on programming and the conversation informal instead of mathematical.

If you are an experienced programmer who already knows Python, you may already 
know everything that this book can teach you. But this book may still
be useful to you by suggesting some programming challenges related to data
science that you may want to try. And if you're familiar with Python but not
with NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib, this book will help you learn those.

Oh the other hand, if you are not an experienced programmer, then this book 
is definitely for you. It will teach you everything you need to know in order
to build some useful data science applications.
