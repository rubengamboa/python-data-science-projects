In this project, you will learn

* How to work with Python variables
* Different Python types, e.g., integers, Booleans, and strings
* Conditionals (if statements)
* Loops and range
* Formatting strings

## Project: How Many Primes Are There between 1 and 100?

Prime numbers are beautiful and mysterious, and they also have many practical applications, such as cryptography. An interesting question is how many prime numbers there are, and we will explore this question in this chapter and the next.

A prime number is an integer greater than or equal to 2 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. For example, 5 is a prime number, because only 1 and 5 can divide it. However, 6 is not a prime number, because 2 divides 6 evenly.

There are 4 primes between 1 and 10, namely 2, 3, 5, and 7. In this project, you will find the prime numbers between 1 and 100 and report how many there are. For instance, if there are 42 primes in this range, your program may print the following:

> There are 42 primes from 1 to 100.

If you know enough Python to complete this project, that's great! Go ahead and write the code, then move on to the next project! If not, don't worry. Take a look at the remainder of this chapter to learn what you need to know to do this project, then come back and do it.

## Variables and Expressions

Programming involves identifying some relevant set of data and manipulating
this data in order to achieve the intended results. For instance, if your
program is intended to analyze the relationship between movies' critical
score and their box-office revenue, then the relevant set of data involves
(1) the critical score, and (2) the box-office revenue of each movie. You
will see in a later project how you may manipulate this data to find the
relationship (if any) between these facts.

In code, all data is stored in *variables*, which you can think of as
a data point that has a name. For example, some of my favorite football 
player's stats may be stored in the variables `height`, `weight`, 
`arm_length`, `hand_size`, and `dash_40`. I chose those names carefully. 
Each is descriptive, so that you have a good chance to guess what data
may be stored in the respective variable. I.e., you can probably guess
that whatever is stored in the variable `height` is in fact the heigth
of my favorite football player. I also followed the standard **naming
conventions** when I chose those names.  All of them are in lower case,
and a single underscore separates multiple words, as in `arm_length`.
Moreover, I had to make some sacrifices due the **naming rules** of
Python. According to these rules, variables names may contain letters,
digits, and underscores, and the name must start with either a letter
or an underscore. That explains why I settled for `dash_40` instead of
the more descriptive name `40_yard_dash`, which isn't a valid name.

The (i-am-here)

{lang=python}

        height = 75
        weight = 246
        arm_length = 33.5
        hand_size = 9.25
        dash_40 = 4.42
