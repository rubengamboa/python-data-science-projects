# Python Basics

## Goals

In this project, you will learn

* How to work with Python variables
* Different Python types, e.g., integers, Booleans, and strings
* Loops and range
* Formatting strings

## Project: How Many Primes Are There between 1 and 100?

Prime numbers are beautiful and mysterious, and they also have many 
practical applications, such as cryptography. An interesting question
is how many prime numbers there are, and we will explore this question
in this chapter and the next.

A prime number is an integer greater than or equal to 2 that is divisible
only by 1 and itself. For example, 5 is a prime number, because only 1
and 5 can divide it. However, 6 is not a prime number, because 2 divides
6 evenly.

There are 4 primes between 1 and 10, namely 2, 3, 5, and 7. In this project,
you will find the prime numbers between 1 and 100 and report how many there
are. For instance, if there are 42 primes in this range, your program may
print
```
There are 42 primes from 1 to 100.
```
