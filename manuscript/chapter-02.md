# Simple Plots: How Many Primes between 1 and N?

In this project, you will learn

* How to define your own functions in Python
* How to use unit tests to make sure your code is working
* How design decisions can impact the performance of your code
* How to create basic line graphs using matplotlib

## Project: How Many Primes Are There between 1 and N?

In the last project, we wrote a program to discover how many primes there are between 1 and 100. In this project, we'll explore how the number of primes grows as we count them from 1 to 100, 1 to 1,000, 1 to 10,000, and so on.

To do this, we will start with refactoring the solution from the previous project so that it becomes a function that can be used to find the number of primes between 1 and N. Then we can use this function to count the primes in varying ranges (e.g., up to 100, 200, 300, and so on) and display them in a graph like the following.
